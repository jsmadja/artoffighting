decompress everything in your C drive
You should get an MRI folder
Launch DOSBOX (heh yes it doesn't work under windows x64).
Go in MRI
launch SetPath
go in AOF
launch make
go in bin
launch makeout
then, from a windows command line (not dosbox)
in this same folder, launch makerom
and you will get the file 044-p1.p1, the program code.
